femto blog system

femto lives up to its name: Being a minimalistic system, it satisfies all my requirements for a blog system (and maybe yours as well): **simple**, **speedy** and **secure**.
femto is no overkill software. It tries to do one thing well, without bugging you. Nevertheless/Therefore the feature list tells its own tale:

### Features
* multilingual,
* comments function,
* simple, modern and responsive design,
* high-level security standards,
* convenient administration,
* multi user and permissions administration,
* ATOM Feed and sitemap.xml generation,
* clean code and
* of course, Open Source and Free Software.
